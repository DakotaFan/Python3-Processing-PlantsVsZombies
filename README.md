# Python3-Processing-PlantsVsZombies
This is the final project we created for the intro to computer science class at NYU Abu Dhabi. It requires the Processing 3 and python to run. Please don't copy it for your own purpose (neither academic or commercial usage). If you need the resources(either images or sounds), please send emails to jf3539@nyu.edu for further details. All of the images/sounds are from the Internet.

This package is only for learning and discussion purposes. Hope you will have fun with this classical game!
